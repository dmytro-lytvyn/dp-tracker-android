# Data Platform: Events Tracker for Android

This is a demo application that starts an Android service, that subscribes to various system events and sends them to Data Platform via an HTTP endpoint in JSON format. It provides a simple source of real-life events and allows for some basic analysis of mobile device users' behavior.
